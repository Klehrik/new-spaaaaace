![Showcase of new spaaaaace](https://github.com/Klehrik/new-spaaaaace/assets/78520710/abf853b8-cce0-424e-b734-17d0a4f957eb)


The successor to [spaaaaaace](https://github.com/Klehrik/spaaaaaace), featuring actually nice graphics.  
Weapons had an overheat mechanic if you used them for too long, requiring you to actually fire when necessary instead of holding the button.  
Also features ally ships that kinda help??
